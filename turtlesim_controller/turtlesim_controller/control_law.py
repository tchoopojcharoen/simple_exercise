):
    """
    Compute the linear and angular velocity commands for a go-to-goal controller.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pose : list or None
        Current robot pose in the form [x, y, theta].
        x and y are the current position.
        theta is the current heading angle in radians.

    goal : list or None
        Desired goal position in the form [x_goal, y_goal].

    Kv : float
        Linear velocity gain.
        A larger Kv makes the robot move faster toward the goal.

    Kw : float
        Angular velocity gain.
        A larger Kw makes the robot turn faster toward the goal direction.

    tolerance : float
        Distance threshold for stopping.
        If the robot is closer than this distance to the goal,
        the function returns zero velocity.

    Returns
    -------
    v : float
        Linear velocity command.

    w : float
        Angular velocity command.
